# AYY THIS MY README


Welcome to Dungeons & Taverns! With this app, you no longer have to go through the trouble of being creative and making up your own shops! At the push of a button, a shop is generated with a random NPC, Images, Items, and Name. Items are generated based on the shop type, and the NPC has a chance of having a small side quest! Edit any items you don't like, with a button to create even more just in case!
